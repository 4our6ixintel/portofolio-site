    <h1>Why I Chose Frontend Web Development</h1>
    <p>As a creative person who enjoys design and problem-solving, frontend development felt like the perfect fit. I love turning code into something people can see, touch, and interact with.</p>
    <p>Frontend gives me the power to control how a website looks and behaves. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I can create fast, beautiful, and functional sites that work on any device.</p>
    <p>It also challenges me to keep learning â€” from new frameworks like React to CSS tricks and performance optimization. Every project pushes me to improve, and that's what keeps it exciting.</p>
